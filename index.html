        <h3>Lane So Far</h3>
        <p>My experience at Lanee has overall been going smoothly. There are some days where everything feels great and there's others not so much. I've enjoyed getting to know and meet people in my classes. I'm better at science than I am at math but I stay on top of most classes. </p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Soccer is my favorite hobby because I like staying active. I find it exciting and challenging. Whether I'm playing with friends or practicing on my own, soccer always helps me improve my skills. It's a great way to relieve stress and feel connected to others people who love the sport as well.Other things I like to do is play the game and taking walks, both are really relaxing and help get my mind refreshed</p>

        <p>I come from a mexican family alongside 2 sisters. i went to school near Edgewater at Stephen K. Hayt elementary. I have 3 cousins that previously went here which is what inspired me to chase my acadamic pursuit here at Lane. </p>

        <h3>Plans for the future</h3>
        <p>I've always wondered "how" things work, which is why I'm planning to pursue a career as a mechanical engineer. I am want to be involved in solving real-world problems by designing, innovating, and advances technology. To achieve this goal, I plan to develop a strong foundation in math and physics during my studies here at Lane Tech. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to creating efficient and sustainable solutions in industries like automotive or technological.</p>
