        <p> More about Soccer,It's a great way for me relieve stress and feel connected to others people who love the sport as well. I have actually made a lot of friends through this sport which i'm very fortunate. I have been playing for a while now, I started playing when I was 5. My love for the sport grew with my family, most of my family is into it therefore that's what I grew up with and wouldn't change anything for it.  </p>

        <h3 class="text-center">My Club</h3>
        <p>The team that I grew up supporting was Liverpool. From watching them on saturday mornings when I was little was what made me support them, They have been a great team historically and currently. My older cousin supports Liverpool as well which is another reason why I support them. They have had some tough losses throughout the years but YNWA.</p>

        <p>Apart from Soccer, I also like football fairly. I like watching the Bears on sundays. Although they may not be the best currently they will bounce back. My favorite player on the bears is Rome Odunze and alongside Caleb they will do great things in Chicago. Same as Liverpool my family are bears fans which got me into football. </p>
